# Selective Import Demo
# Import only specific definitions from another file

# Only import what we need
import [methyl, ethyl, hydroxyl] from "./base-fragments.selfies"

# Now we can only use methyl, ethyl, and hydroxyl
[methanol] = [methyl][hydroxyl]
[ethanol] = [ethyl][hydroxyl]

# These would NOT work because we didn't import them:
# [toluene] = [methyl][phenyl]  # Error: phenyl not imported
