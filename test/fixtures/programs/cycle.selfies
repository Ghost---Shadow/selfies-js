# Circular dependency examples
# These definitions reference each other in a cycle
# Should produce errors

# Simple cycle
[a] = [b]
[b] = [a]

# Self-reference
[recursive] = [recursive]

# Longer cycle
[x] = [y]
[y] = [z]
[z] = [x]

# Valid definition that doesn't participate in cycle
[valid] = [C][C][O]
